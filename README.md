# üß† AutismNetX: Screening of Autism through Machine Learning

AutismNetX is a scalable, interpretable, and high-accuracy screening tool for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). By combining advanced supervised learning algorithms (XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks) with Explainable AI and imbalance-handling techniques (SMOTE), it delivers rapid, data-driven early detection using demographic, behavioral, and clinical features.

## Project Overview

Autism Spectrum Disorder is a complex neurodevelopmental condition affecting social interaction, communication, and behavior. Traditional screening methods rely on expert evaluation and can be slow or subjective. AutismNetX offers:

- **Automated, scalable screening** using structured questionnaire and demographic data  
- **High accuracy** (~97% classification accuracy) on unseen test sets  
- **Interpretable predictions** via SHAP-based feature importance  
- **Adaptable framework** for clinics, schools, and home environments  

---

## Key Features & Objectives

1. **Predictive Modeling**  
   - Use supervised ML to classify ASD vs. non-ASD  
   - Incorporate Autism Quotient (AQ) scores (A1‚ÄìA10)

2. **Imbalance Handling**  
   - Apply SMOTE to synthesize minority-class samples  
   - Optimize for precision, recall, and F1-score  

3. **Explainable AI**  
   - Generate SHAP explanations for model transparency  
   - Identify top predictive features (e.g., AQ questions A4, A5, A8)

4. **Scalable & Generalizable**  
   - Hybrid architectures: XGBoost, LightGBM, Neural Networks  
   - Cross-validation (K-Fold) and hyperparameter tuning  

5. **Ethics & Privacy**  
   - Secure handling of sensitive data  
   - Mitigate misclassification risks (false positives/negatives)

## Motivation

- **Early Intervention:** Timely ASD detection can dramatically improve long-term outcomes.  
- **Resource Efficiency:** Automated screening reduces dependence on specialist availability.  
- **Clinical Trust:** Explainable AI fosters adoption in healthcare settings.

## Dataset

- **Source:** UCI ‚ÄúAutism Screening Adult Dataset‚Äù  
- **Features:**  
  - Demographics: Age, gender, ethnicity, country  
  - AQ Questionnaire responses (A1‚ÄìA10)  
  - Family history, relationship status, screening results  
- **Target:** Binary `Class/ASD` label (Yes/No)

---

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing

- **Missing Value Imputation:** Mean/mode replacement or KNN imputation  
- **Normalization & Encoding:** Min‚ÄìMax scaling; one-hot / label encoding  
- **SMOTE:** Synthetic Minority Over-sampling to balance classes  

### 2. Feature Engineering

- **Synthetic Augmentation:** Noise injection and bootstrapping for generalization  

### 3. Model Training & Optimization

- **Algorithms:**  
  - **Ensemble:** XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest  
  - **Deep Learning:** Fully-connected Neural Networks (ReLU activations)  
- **Validation:** 5-Fold Cross-Validation  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Grid Search / Bayesian Optimization  

### 4. Evaluation & Metrics

- **Accuracy:** Overall correctness  
- **Precision & Recall:** Focus on sensitivity to ASD cases  
- **F1-Score:** Balance between precision and recall  
- **ROC-AUC & Confusion Matrix:** Discrimination ability and error analysis
